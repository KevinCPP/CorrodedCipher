# RustyCryptor
CS498 senior project for computer science

**Project Statement:**
We are building an encryption app, *RustyCryptor*, which will allow users to easily encrypt and decrypt files or directories. It will also have a hashing functionality, which will allow users to generate a hash of their files/directories, using various hashing algorithms.

**Major Goals:**
The base app will be written in Rust and will have a CLI to interact with it. This will be the backbone of the project. A GUI will be created to enable users unfamiliar with the command line to be able to easily use *RustyCryptor*. Implementation details are up to those who are working on this portion. Finally, a Website will be constructed which serves as a presentation for our project, going over it's various features and use-cases. Again, implementation details are up to those who are working on this portion.
